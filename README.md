# digitalhive_sender

It's a piece of code that ran on a raspberry 3B+ that was connected to a [Tinkerforge](https://www.tinkerforge.com/en/) that collected data from one of my beehives. I don't use it anymore as it didn't give me too much valuable data. During the season I'm at my bees weekly, so I don't really need the data and maintaining the system distracted from the actuall beekeeping.
